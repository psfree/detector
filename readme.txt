To use the face-tracking system, ensure all the hardware is connected and present.
Program the Arduino using the IDE or if already programmed and running you may skip this step. 
On the computer, ensure the Arduino is connected using the included USB cable as well
as the video decoder which is also connected via USB. Start the python code by double clicking the file “detect.py” 
in the folder containing the code. You will be presented with a list of available Serial ports to choose. 
Generally the last item will be the Arduino you will want to connect with. Simply type the number of the item listed and the 
script will begin receiving the video stream and communicating with the Arduino. Once this is working a window will appear that
shows the detected features in real time. No other input is required other than the use of the joystick to control the 
position of the camera. The face-tracking mode can be disabled or enabled by pressing the button labeled E on the joystick board.
